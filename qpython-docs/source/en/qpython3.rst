[ FAQ ]
A: Why can't I use the SMS API of SL4A
Q: Because Google Play and some app stores have strict requirements on the permissions of apps, in QPython 3x, we use x to distinguish branches with different permissions or appstores. For example, L means LIMITED and S means SENSITIVE.
Sometimes you cannot use the corresponding SL4A APIs because the version you installed does not have the corresponding permissions, so you can consider replace what you have installed with the right one.
