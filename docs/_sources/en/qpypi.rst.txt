QPYPI
======
You can extend your QPython capabilities by installing packages.
Because of different computer architectures, we cannot guarantee that QPYPI includes all packages in PYPI.
If you want us to support a package that is not currently supported, you can raise an issue in the QPYPI project


QPySLA Package
--------------

qsl4ahelper
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
It extends qpysl4a's APIs. Now the below project depends on it.

AIPY Packages
----------------

AIPY is a high-level AI learning app, based on related libraries like Numpy, Scipy, theano, keras, etc.... It was developed with a focus on helping you learn and practise AI programming well and fast.

Numpy
>>>>>>>
NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python. This package contains:

::

  a powerful N-dimensional array object
  sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
  basic linear algebra functions
  basic Fourier transforms
  sophisticated random number capabilities
  tools for integrating Fortran code
  tools for integrating C/C++ code


Scipy
>>>>>>>>
SciPy refers to several related but distinct entities:

::

  The SciPy ecosystem, a collection of open source software for scientific computing in Python.
  The community of people who use and develop this stack.
  Several conferences dedicated to scientific computing in Python - SciPy, EuroSciPy and SciPy.in.
  The SciPy library, one component of the SciPy stack, providing many numerical routines.
